I believe an E-Commerce successful strategy is all about full optimization using best-practices and latest cutting-edge technology whilst keeping the brand authentic (if we hide your logo on your webstore, we should be able to tell, it IS your brand). This optimisation should be done comprehensively (traffic acquisition, landing pages, products pages, checkout, payments, logistic (till the last mile!) and customer retention (your customer service should be at the core of your business).
