  Illustration by Jules Julien When Liu Yiqian, 52, a chain-smoking former taxi
  driver, purchased Modigliani's 1917 oil on canvas "Nu Couché" last November
  for a stunning $170.4 million, the Chinese billionaire made headlines around
  the world-not only because the purchase price was the second highest ever paid
  at auction for a painting but also because Liu used his American Express card
  to buy it.
