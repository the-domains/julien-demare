description: "A hyperloop startup has built the first full-scale test track for the transportation system in the desert outside Las Vegas. Today, Hyperloop One (formerly Hyperloop Technologies) pushed a test vehicle down a rail track at speeds of up to 300 mph using the hyperloop's propulsion technology. It looked like a really fast roller coaster."
