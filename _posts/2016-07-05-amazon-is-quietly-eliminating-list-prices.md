      Amazon has launched a new sales program aimed at helping startups bring
      products to market. Introduced today, Launchpad promises to help small
      companies with marketing and onboarding, while leveraging Amazon's huge
      customer base and network of fulfillment centers. The lure for startups is
      reduced cost of getting a product in front of potential customers, by
      using Amazon's retail channels and infrastructure.

  "They still need to showcase deals, but the question is, How?" said Michael
  Kovarik, who runs a comparison-pricing start-up called Rout. That is why
  stores love big discounts: they work. In studies by Mr. Compeau and others,
  the perception of a deal is often what makes the purchase happen.
