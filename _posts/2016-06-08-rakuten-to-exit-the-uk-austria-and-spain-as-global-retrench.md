  Rakuten is downsizing its international presence once again after Japan's top
  e-commerce firm announced plans to shutter its e-commerce businesses in three
  countries in Europe. The move to close Rakuten.co.uk in the UK and Rakuten.es
  and Spain, as well as Rakuten's offices in Cambridge and Barcelona, mirrors a
  similar streamlining decision in February, when the company pulled out of
  Southeast Asia, restructured its presence in Brazil and wrote down $340
  million in assets.
