  Don't expect Twitter Inc. to remain its own company for long. If the current
  path doesn't change, a sale is basically unavoidable, according to Suntrust
  Robinson Humphrey Inc. analyst Robert Peck. "We note that if the current trend
  of meager user and engagement growth remains, we think it's inevitable that
  Twitter will need to pursue M&A alternatives as has been discussed in the
  media for some time," he writes.
