  Amazon shattered expectations when it reported second quarter earnings after
  the bell on Thursday. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.78, when Wall
  Street was forecasting $1.11. Amazon also beat revenue predictions, posting
  $30.4 billion for the quarter when analysts were expecting $29.55 billion.
  Amazon tends to make a lot of experimental bets.
