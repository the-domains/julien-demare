            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Watch the First Full-Scale Demo of the Hyperloop</h1><p>A hyperloop startup has built the first full-scale test track for the transportation system in the desert outside Las Vegas. Today, Hyperloop One (formerly Hyperloop Technologies) pushed a test vehicle down a rail track at speeds of up to 300 mph using the hyperloop's propulsion technology. It looked like a really fast roller coaster.</p><img src="http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--Ntx89Z-l--/c_scale,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/wvtjjvbvaq6brce1hwbg.png"></article>]]></description>

No technology will automate away more jobs - or drive more economic efficiency - than the driverless truck.

But the classrooms they spend so much of their time in remain stubbornly resistant to transformation.
