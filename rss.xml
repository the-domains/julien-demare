The move to close Rakuten.co.uk in the UK and Rakuten.es and Spain, as well as Rakuten's offices in Cambridge and Barcelona, mirrors a similar streamlining decision in February, when the company pulled out of Southeast Asia, restructured its presence in Brazil and wrote down $340 million in assets.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7b427bad0fc48fb90ae10d94c1d073f6b6d4dc4a.jpg"></article>]]></description>

If the current path doesn't change, a sale is basically unavoidable, according to Suntrust Robinson Humphrey Inc. analyst Robert Peck. "We note that if the current trend of meager user and engagement growth remains, we think it's inevitable that Twitter will need to pursue M&A alternatives as has been discussed in the media for some time," he writes.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fb556e3711e557267446015f8ee53265cf273beb.jpg"></article>]]></description>
