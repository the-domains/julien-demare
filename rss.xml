            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Rakuten to exit the UK, Austria and Spain as global retrenchment continues</h1><p>Rakuten is downsizing its international presence once again after Japan's top e-commerce firm announced plans to shutter its e-commerce businesses in three countries in Europe. The move to close Rakuten.co.uk in the UK and Rakuten.es and Spain, as well as Rakuten's offices in Cambridge and Barcelona, mirrors a similar streamlining decision in February, when the company pulled out of Southeast Asia, restructured its presence in Brazil and wrote down $340 million in assets.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7b427bad0fc48fb90ae10d94c1d073f6b6d4dc4a.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Analyst: Twitter M&amp;A Is 'Inevitable' if Current Trends Continue</h1><p>Don't expect Twitter Inc. to remain its own company for long. If the current path doesn't change, a sale is basically unavoidable, according to Suntrust Robinson Humphrey Inc. analyst Robert Peck. "We note that if the current trend of meager user and engagement growth remains, we think it's inevitable that Twitter will need to pursue M&A alternatives as has been discussed in the media for some time," he writes.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fb556e3711e557267446015f8ee53265cf273beb.jpg"></article>]]></description>
