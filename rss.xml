The move to close Rakuten.co.uk in the UK and Rakuten.es and Spain, as well as Rakuten's offices in Cambridge and Barcelona, mirrors a similar streamlining decision in February, when the company pulled out of Southeast Asia, restructured its presence in Brazil and wrote down $340 million in assets.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7b427bad0fc48fb90ae10d94c1d073f6b6d4dc4a.jpg"></article>]]></description>

If the current path doesn't change, a sale is basically unavoidable, according to Suntrust Robinson Humphrey Inc. analyst Robert Peck.
