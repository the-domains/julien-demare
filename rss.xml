            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Key Players in Climate Change</h1><p>The United States pledged that it will cut greenhouse gas pollution between 26 to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025. But its ability to meet that goal was thrown into question in February, when the Supreme Court unexpectedly put a hold on implementing a major environmental regulation aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/860502a7401502a37016d44a5b17c93b9d4c9f9c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>NASA pours $67 million into solar electric spacecraft engines</h1><p>NASA is big on solar electric propulsion (the Dawn spacecraft uses it, for instance) for a good reason: while the engines aren't powerful, they supply thrust for a very long time before giving up the ghost. And it now looks like the agency is ready to double down on that super-efficient tech.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/955bf819334fc01157f0d67a9549a74f525e5e80.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Ikea is selling solar panels in UK shops (Wired UK)</h1><p>All of Ikea's UK stores will be selling solar panels by the end of the year, the company has said. Stores in Birmingham, Grays and Glasgow have started selling selling solar panels, with Manchester and Southampton following in May. The decision comes despite government cuts to feed-in tariffs and a drop in the number of solar installations.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/1753cd4f8278a461719987ef76d1cf3e6838604d.jpg"></article>]]></description>
