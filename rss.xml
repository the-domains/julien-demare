            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Elon Musk just made a totally mind-blowing change to Tesla's strategy</h1><p>Tesla reported first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, and they were better than expected: Tesla lost less money than analysts thought the company would.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The driverless truck is coming, and it's going to automate millions of jobs</h1><p>A convoy of self-driving trucks recently drove across Europe and arrived at the Port of Rotterdam. No technology will automate away more jobs - or drive more economic efficiency - than the driverless truck. Shipping a full truckload from L.A. to New York costs around $4,500 today, with labor representing 75 percent of that cost.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/195ace9555d62a38cbf892e8582226effac569db.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Can AI fix education? We asked Bill Gates</h1><p>The rise of smartphones has transformed the way students communicate and entertain themselves. But the classrooms they spend so much of their time in remain stubbornly resistant to transformation. On one hand, technology has long had a home in classrooms - I learned to type on an Apple IIe in the late 1980s.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4845fee62baf76213337626e8a29a0f2c756e220.jpg"></article>]]></description>

And it now looks like the agency is ready to double down on that super-efficient tech.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/955bf819334fc01157f0d67a9549a74f525e5e80.jpg"></article>]]></description>
